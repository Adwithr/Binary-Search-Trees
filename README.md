# Binary Search Tree

Through this project, I gained practical experience in:

- Understanding the core concepts of a Binary Search Tree (BST), including node ordering.
- Implementing the foundational `Node` and `Tree` structure.
- Developing the logic to build a _balanced_ BST efficiently from a sorted array (`buildTree`).
- Implementing methods for modifying the tree, including inserting nodes (`insert`) while maintaining BST properties and handling the complex cases of deleting nodes (`deleteItem`) based on their children (zero, one, or two).
- Performing different types of tree traversals (`levelOrder`, `inOrder`, `preOrder`, `postOrder`).
- Calculating properties of the tree, such as the height and depth of nodes (`height`, `depth`).
- Checking if the tree is balanced (`isBalanced`) according to the height difference rule.
- Implementing a method to rebalance the tree (`rebalance`) when it becomes unbalanced.

This project served as a valuable learning exercise to solidify my understanding of this fundamental data structure and the algorithms associated with it, particularly concerning balance.
